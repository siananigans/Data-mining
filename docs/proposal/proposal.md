## SECTION B

### Introduction

Our proposed project is a Python web app to aid studying.The application will allow users to upload text or link a webpage, from which a number of questions can be generated
The answers the user will give for the questions will be corrected by the application and then release a score to the user.
This web-app is supposed to help students prepare and practice for an exam. 
For the moment we are focusing on CASE 4 modules to train our data as we are most familiar with that. 
Once we feel it performs to standard we can expand to other modules.


### Outline

The application can be broken down into several (number) components.

<br />
The main aspect of the project is Natural Language Processing. We need to be able to take the text given, process it and ask the user questions on it.

The bulk of the project is the AI for creating questions and answers based on text. For this we will need to work with Natural language processing, we plan to do this with a Neural Network algorithm. 


<br />

The other components consist of: a text uploader, a ‘scoring system’, a HTML linking and scraping system, a log-in/account system and a user interface.


### Background

The idea came about when reading about Natural Language processing and that it could be used for creating questions from text. We thought that this could be implemented well for students trying to learn and thought of this app.

### Achievements

We hope to achieve an all inclusive app for studiers to be quizzed on their notes and topics. The user should also be able to log-in and out of the app with their score for each text uploaded displayed for them. 



### Justification

Rather than just reading off a set of notes, people could be quizzed on their topic and receive a ‘score’ based on their knowledge of these notes.

We believe this will greatly benefit anyone studying for exams, specifically students coming up to exam season.

### Programming language(s)

- Python - Backend/ Neural network.
- SQL - For database in backend.
- HTML - For frontend.
- CSS - For frontend.
- JavaScript - For frontend.
- Markdown - Docs

### Programming tools / Tech stack

- Django - Framework for backend and frontend.
- TensorFlow - Machine learning/Neural Network Library
- MySQL - Database management.
- Visual studio - text editor.
- Selenium - Testing.
- Boostrap - Library.
- AWS - Amazon web services web hosting
- Docker - Containers


### Learning Challenges

We have never built any kind of machine learning system before, this will most likely be the biggest challenge however there are plenty of online resources for TensorFlow used with Python for Neural networks.



New Tech:

- TensorFlow
- SQLite
- Boostrap
- AWS
- Docker


### Breakdown of work

The work will be split evenly with Sian taking the lead on creating the Natural Language Processing and Shannon working on the django app setup. The AWS and docker containers will be created together. Docs will be split evenly.
