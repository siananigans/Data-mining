### Introduction

Our proposed project is a data-mining based research project specifically focusing on anomaly detection. The project will investigate the usefulness of different anomaly detection techniques for a number of different datasets.

### Outline

The main goal of the project is to create and apply a number of anomaly detection algorithms using various techniques on different data-sets. The purpose of this is to find the best suited algorithm for anomaly detection for each particular data-set.

Although it is to be further confirmed, we plan on using 3 techniques. One density-based technique such as; k-nearest neighbor, local outlier factor, isolation forests.
One cluster analysis algorithm, looking for bursts of outlying activity. And finally a Bayesian Networks approach.

The datasets we plan on using are also not locked down. However, we would like to use 3 separate datasets that differ in structure to get the best result. One possibly on card transactions, one on health-care and one on weather or sea levels over the years.

Once the algorithms have been developed and applied to the datasets, the next step would be analysis. We will prepare a report of our findings based on the results gathered from running the algorithms over our datasets. Our plan is to be able to say which algorithm worked well with which dataset and why.


### Background

The idea for this project first arose when brainstorming ideas for the project together. We liked the idea of doing a data-mining project as it is an area which we are both interested in. We then came across anomaly detection and realised it is a huge area within data-analytics. The both of us began looking into what we could do with this. We then became aware that there are multiple techniques used for anomaly detection and finding the best one for each data-set can be troubling. This is when we decided on creating different anomaly detection algorithms based on different techniques. We could then test these techniques on multiple data-sets to possibly find the ‘right’ technique. This is how this research based project idea came about.

### Achievements

The main function of this project is to gain an insight into the different anomaly detection techniques and which are useful for which type of datasets.

We will provide a report once our research is complete. This report will specify our findings for each technique and data-set and our conclusions based on these findings.

### Justification

Anomaly detection is used to find outliers in datasets. It finds rare items, observations or events that raise suspicion ad they differ significantly from the rest of the data. So why is anomaly detection useful? Anomalies in data can often suggest issues such as bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects or even errors in text.

Our plan is to research the different techniques used for anomaly detection and show what techniques should be used for which datasets. Hopefully, anyone hoping to find anomalies in their dataset can learn from our research and choose a technique specific for their dataset based on our findings.

### Programming language(s)

### Programming tools / Tech stack

Pandas
MySQL


### Learning Challenges

New Tech:

Jupyter notebook
Statistical modeling
Database management/MySQL
SQL

### Breakdown of work

Our strategy at the beginning is to research different techniques separately. 

We then will start working together to set up the datasets with the MySQL database manager.

From there we will split the techniques and individually work on creating an algorithm for all datasets.

As we are doing 3 techniques, the person done first with their original technique will take the last.

From there, we will gather the results and display them for each of the techniques we worked on. We will do a preliminary report on each technique.

The last step will be to gather all results and investigate them, creating a final report based on all techniques and data-sets.
